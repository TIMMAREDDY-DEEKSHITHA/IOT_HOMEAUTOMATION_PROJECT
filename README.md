# IOT_HOMEAUTOMATION_PROJECT
This repository contains the code and resources for a Home Automation System developed during my internship as an IoT intern at Emertxe. The project focuses on creating a smart home environment where devices can be controlled remotely and automatically and it is done in a virtual mode.

# Features
Control appliances (lights,temp,water level etc.) through a mobile app/web interface.
Automate devices based on environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.).
Real-time monitoring of home status (device state, sensor data).
Supports Wi-Fi-based communication for seamless connectivity.
# Technologies Used
Software: Arduino IDE, MQTT Protocol, picsimlab simulator, virtual ports ,Apower mirror app
Languages: C/C++
Cloud: Firebase/MQTT broker for real-time data communication
